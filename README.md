">Ecommerece App</h1>

In this project, I have developed the Ecommerce ReactJS application, a modern e-commerce platform built with React. This app provides a user-friendly experience for browsing and managing products. Users can explore a catalog of items, view detailed product information, and add products to their cart.

The key components and functionalities of this project include:

- **Product Listing**: Users can view a list of available products with detailed information for each item. This feature is implemented using React components that handle the display and interaction with product data.
- **Product Details**: Clicking on a product takes users to a detailed view where they can see more information, such as price, description, and similar products.
- **Cart Management**: Users can add products to their cart, adjust quantities, and view the cart's contents. This functionality is supported by React Context for state management, allowing for a seamless cart experience.
- **Notifications**: A notification system provides feedback to users when they add items to the cart. The notification fades out after a few seconds and reappears with each new action.
- **Routing**: Implemented using React Router, enabling smooth navigation between different pages such as product details and the home page.

**Technologies used**: React JS, React Router, CSS, REST API Calls, React Context, State Management, Notifications

In summary, the Ecommerce ReactJS application is a comprehensive solution for managing an online shopping experience. It combines React's powerful features with intuitive UI components to offer users a dynamic, interactive, and secure platform for browsing and purchasing products.
